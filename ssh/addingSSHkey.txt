First you have to create a directory in working tree. 

Run GIT status command. 

If it shows fatal then it is good. 

Run GIT init command to make your directory a GIT repository

Now add some files in your directory. 

Run git add -A
    git add --a
    git add . 
    git add <file name>

Now check status and check whether everything is going well. 
Then commit your changes by command. 
git commit -m "<your message>"

Now check your status again. 
And do some changes if you want to do. 
And commit them. 

Now open your GitHub account and create an empty reporitry. 
And name it similar to your directory in working tree. 

Copy paste a command Starting with 'git remote.....' to termux. 

Now run following commands. 
git remote
git remote add origin -v
 IF you get 3 links after running these 3 commands then it is ok. 

Install openssh by.  
pkg install openssh

Now copy following command to termux. AS IT IS
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Now copy following command to termux. AS IT IS
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Now copy following command to termux. AS IT IS
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Now copy following command to termux. AS IT IS
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


Now you will get a key in TERMUX and copy this key. 
Now open your repository in GitHub 
Click on burger menu. 
Click on settings. 
Click on SSH and GPG keys.
Click on add a new key. 
Enter a (GOOD) name for your key in upper box. 
PASTE THE key you have copied from termux in lower box. 
NOW GENERATE YOUR KEY. By clicking on green button. 


git push -u origin master


Now copy ssh url from your new GitHub reporitry. 
And paste it into following command. 
git remote set-url origin <paste the URL you copied>

Now run the following command again. 
git push -u origin master
   

Above command will push your git local commits to 
 GitHub server. 

Now 2nd time you have to push files to GitHub server
 you have to just enter following command. 
git push
This will record your changes to GitHub reporitry. 



git pull 
command is to pull the changes from GitHub repositry
that other people have committed. 

===================================================
REMEMBER

~GIT AND GITHUB ARE 2 DIFFERENT THINGS

~IF U HAVE 2 OR MORE BRANCHES THERE U HAVE TO WORK DIFFERENTLY
  WE WILL SEE THAT LATER. 
  my suggestion is do not create 2nd branch now. 

STILL TO KNOW ABOUT
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> navlyut

==================================================

git clone <url> <folder>
